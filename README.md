# Task Manager App using React(Vite)

I'm happy to share my latest project: a React Vite task manager app deployed on Vercel. It boasts a user-friendly interface for managing your tasks, offering features like:

-> Effortless Task Creation: Simply add a description and save the task.

-> Seamless Editing: Modify existing tasks as needed, updating details and completion status.

-> Task Removal: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant with ease.

-> Completion Toggling: Mark tasks as done or undone with a single click. Completed tasks are visually distinct for clarity.

-> Optional Completion Hiding: Exclude finished tasks from the main view for a clutter-free experience.

Some of the Important concepts i learned throughout this project are:

-> Components

-> Props

-> Event Handling

This Project is deployed using vercel and is live on the link :
