# React + Vite

# I'm happy to share my latest project: a React Vite task manager app deployed on Vercel. It boasts a user-friendly interface for managing your tasks, offering features like:

# Effortless Task Creation: Simply add a description and choose the initial completion status.
# Seamless Editing: Modify existing tasks as needed, updating details and completion status.
# Task Removal: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant with ease.
# Completion Toggling: Mark tasks as done or undone with a single click. Completed tasks are visually distinct for clarity.
# Optional Completion Hiding: Exclude finished tasks from the main view for a clutter-free experience.

### This Project is deployed using vercel and is live on the link : task-master-react-app.vercel.app
